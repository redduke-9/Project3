 <h2>Online Auction FAQs</h2></center>
<br><br>
Online auctions are an exciting place to find a variety of lots but how does it all work? Are they safe? How can you get involved?
In this guide, we're going to make the world of online auctions a lot more transparent, so you can understand what happens in different scenarios and what you can expect.
From bidding on the wrong item to not having the necessary means to pay, what are some of the most common questions asked about online auctions?
<br><br>
Q) How does a timed-online auction work?<br>
The auctions which we provide are called timed-online auctions. A timed-online auction is held over the internet and lasts for a specific period of time e.g. 2 days, a week or even a month!
The whole process is automated and bidders are updated via email for the following:
If their bid was successful.
If they are the leading bidder.
To ensure the auction is maintained, the auction house can set increments to stop obscure bids being placed. To learn more about online auctions, check out our guide: How do online auctions work?
<br><br>
Q) How do I register for an online auction?<br>
To register for online auctions, you'll need to have an account with the platform the auction is held on.
You'll be prompted to input personal details such as your name, card details and address. Once this has been completed, you'll be able to register for auctions.

<br><br>
Q) Where are the lots located?<br>
To find out where the lot is located, it's usually available on the lot because auctions such as our collective can have multiple locations. 
<br>
If you can't find out where the lot is located then give us a ring and we'll be able to help you.
<br><br>
Q) What happens if you don't pay?<br>
If you win an item and don't pay the total amount then this can cause serious issues between you, the seller and the auction house.
There's a time limit for you to pay and/or collect the goods and they are expressed in the important information.
There have been high profile disputes involving some of the biggest auction houses in the world such as Sotheby's and Christie's. The disadvantage of these disputes is the fact that they can reach the courtroom.
To avoid having a negative auction experience, it's imperative that you are committed to the item you bid on.
<br><br>
Q) What happens if you bid on the wrong item?<br>
If you bid on the wrong item at auction, it's imperative that you contact the auction house immediately.
There's no defined process for situations like this because each auction will have terms and conditions which you need to read before you bid.
If a solution is not found, your bid may likely stand. It's vital that you are on the correct lot before you place your bid because they are legally binding commitments.
<br><br>
Q) If I sell in auction, when do I receive the funds?<br>
As a security measure, we withhold funds to vendors until the winning bidder has received their lot.
When the winning bidder has received their lot and is satisfied, we will begin the process of sending the vendor their funds.
<br><br>
Q) Can I pay by card?<br>
Yes. 
For any invoices over this figure, you'll need to complete an online bank transfer.
<br><br>
Q) What are your bank details?<br>
Our bank details can be found on all the invoices which winning bidders receive. 
<br><br>
Q) What happens if I win an item at auction?<br>
We invoice the winning bidder with a payment request, via e-mail, on the same day as the close of the auction.
The payment request will detail the amount that will need to be paid to us within 2 working days.
Once we have received payment, we will issue a collection notice to put both the vendor and winning bidder in touch. This enables both parties to arrange collection or dispatch. 
<br><br>
Q) If a bidder wins an item, can they return it?<br>
No, our auctions are not regulated by the Distance Selling Act.
We can accept returns when the item is materially different from what is described in the auction.
If the lot you won is different from what was described, it's important that you contact the vendor and us so we're aware of the situation and can assist if required.
If you're having problems with online bidders, we created this guide which is aimed at improving your selling experience by ensuring you're not making some of the most common mistakes in online selling. Check out our guide: Selling at Auction - Mistakes to Avoid.
<br><br>
Q) How do I get my auction items?<br>
We do not keep the lots consigned to auction. They are held by the vendor.
Once the payment request has been paid, the winning bidder will receive a collection note and this will show the vendor's name, e-mail address and contact telephone number. 
The winning bidder will then be able to liaise with the vendor about collection or delivery.
